### About the project

Hi, I'm Elizabeth Hodges and have created an app that marks programming assessments for my third year Computer Science project. I will be analysing how the marks awarded differ from the marks given by Lilian's current marking system.

### Your role
Please attempt the questions in the app and email the generated file containing your answers to ```emh566@york.ac.uk``` - more detailed steps below. 

Note your answers are *not* going to be assessed so please submit any answers including those that are incomplete and/or do not receive all the marks.

### Getting started

Download the application from the links provided below. Once downloaded open up the command prompt and navigate to the folder where the python marker was downloaded to. Once in the folder run the following command:
```.\pythonMarker.exe runserver --noreload```
Navigate to the following in a web-browser (Chrome is recommended) to open the app:
```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```

#### Submitting results
Once you have finished attempting the questions navigate to the submissions page ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit``` and click the submit button. Note that this will not submit your answers, it will however cause a yaml file to be downloaded. 

To submit your results please email this yaml file to ```emh566@york.ac.uk```.

#### Technical difficulties?
Please email me at ```emh566@york.ac.uk``` and I'll be happy to help :)

### Ethics
Please read this section carefully before participating. I will take receiving an e-mail containing an answer file as consent for participating in this project. 

#### What data will be collected?
Your answer to each question, the marks awarded and the results of the test cases will be collected. No hidden or personal data will be collected. You can view the data that will be submitted by opening the yaml file that is created when you click submit. Note the answers are not submitted at this point. Your answers will only be submitted when you email your results to ```emh566@york.ac.uk```.

#### Who will see my answers?
Your answers will be seen by myself as the primary researcher and my supervisor Lilian Blot. Any data included in the write-up of the report or shared with other researchers at the Univeristy of York will be completely anonymized.

#### How will the data be stored?
All data collected will be stored in accordance to the University of Yorkâ€™s data protection guidelines and will be deleted after graduation in summer 2022.

#### Withdrawing consent
You are free to withdraw your data at any point upto and including 20.04.22 by emailing ```emh566@york.ac.uk```. 

#### Questions?
If you have any queries at all about the project please email me ```emh566@york.ac.uk``` or my supervisor Lilian Blot ```lilian.blot@york.ac.uk```.
